================================================================================
  NOTE: Using unfiltered data for Topics/Sentiment/Tone (includes all speakers)
        Using filtered data for Attribution labels (only rows with attributions)

  📊 Full Transcript Analysis (Baseline)
      Creating TWO versions for non-attribution labels:
        1. All Snippets (includes questions, all statements)
        2. Attribution Statements Only (subset where attribution_present='Y')
    ✓ Topic: 7283 categories
    ✓ Topic_Category: 7 categories
    ✓ Temporal_Context: 3 categories
    ✓ Content_Sentiment: 4 categories
    ✓ Speaker_Tone: 4 categories
    ✓ attribution_present: 1 categories

  📊 Section-Level Analysis
      NOTE: Section comparisons also create TWO versions for non-attribution labels
    ✓ prepared_remarks: 239,644 total snippets (non-attr labels), 113,774 attribution snippets
    ✓ qna_section: 703,203 total snippets (non-attr labels), 155,912 attribution snippets

  📊 Team-Level Analysis (Q&A Section Only)
    NOTE: Team analysis focuses on Q&A where both management and analysts participate
    Prepared remarks are primarily management, so team comparison is only meaningful in Q&A
    ⚠️  Attribution labels EXCLUDED from team comparison (external_members don't make attributions)
    ✓  Uses ALL SNIPPETS data (includes questions, all statements) - no 'attribution-only' version
    Available teams in Q&A: ['external_members', 'management_team', 'unknown']
    ✓ management_team: 338,948 Q&A snippets analyzed
    ✓ external_members: 325,934 Q&A snippets analyzed

  ✓ Saved weighted distribution charts to output\gpt_classification_validation\visualizations

3. Analyzing Attribution Outcome Distributions
================================================================================

  📊 Overall Attribution Distribution (n=269,686):
    Positive-Internal   : 125,727 ( 46.6%)

    Positive-Internal: 63.4% (Literature: 69-82%)
      ⚠️  Outside expected range
    Negative-External: 13.0% (Literature: 5-14%)
      ✓ Within expected range

  🎯 Target vs Peer Comparison (using normalized 4-way percentages):
    Targets: n=50,244, Peers: n=219,442
    Positive-Internal   : Target  64.3% vs Peer  63.1% (↑  1.2%)

Aggregate Attribution Statistics:
================================================================================

📊 OVERALL BREAKDOWN (All Companies, All Quarters)
  Total observations: 3,216 company-quarters
  Targets: 551 (17.1%)
  Peers: 2,665 (82.9%)

✓ POSITIVE INTERNAL ATTRIBUTION (taking credit)
  Targets: 23,964 occurrences (47.7% of target attributions)
           Mean rate per quarter: 78.3%
  Peers:   101,763 occurrences (46.4% of peer attributions)
           Mean rate per quarter: 73.1%

✓ NEGATIVE EXTERNAL ATTRIBUTION (blaming outside factors)
  Targets: 4,624 occurrences (9.2% of target attributions)
           Mean rate per quarter: 43.9%
  Peers:   21,144 occurrences (9.6% of peer attributions)
           Mean rate per quarter: 51.9%

📊 PRIMARY METRIC: SAB PROPORTION
  Calculation: (Pos-Int + Neg-Ext) / All Attributions
  Range: 0% to 100%
  Interpretation: Higher % = more self-serving bias
               This is the KEY METRIC for bias detection (absolute proportion)

  🎯 Comparison: Targets show HIGHER SAB proportion than peers (↑ 0.020)

  Targets: Mean 0.582, Median 0.580
           Range: 0.000 to 1.000
  Peers:   Mean 0.562, Median 0.561
           Range: 0.000 to 1.000

📈 SECONDARY METRIC: ATTRIBUTION RATE ASYMMETRY
  Calculation: (Pos-Int rate + Neg-Ext rate) - (Pos-Ext rate + Neg-Int rate)
  Range: -2.0 to +2.0
  Interpretation: +ve = self-serving bias, -ve = reverse bias, 0 = balanced
               NOTE: This measures the imbalance/asymmetry between rate pairs
               SAB Proportion remains the primary metric for hypothesis testing

  🎯 Comparison: Rate asymmetry difference = -0.062

  Targets: Mean 0.655, Median 0.609
           Range: -1.000 to 2.000
  Peers:   Mean 0.716, Median 0.729
           Range: -1.000 to 2.000

⚠ HIGH BIAS PERIODS (top 25% asymmetry)
  106 target company-quarters show elevated bias
  Most frequent targets:
    0LIU.L: 17/28 quarters (61%)
    OTRK: 16/19 quarters (84%)
    SNAP: 10/26 quarters (38%)
    GRPN: 8/49 quarters (16%)
    BHC.TO: 6/28 quarters (21%)
