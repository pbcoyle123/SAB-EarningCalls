[1/5] Supervised Classification - Bias Prediction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4b. Supervised Classification: Expert Period Prediction
================================================================================
Testing: Do embeddings detect patterns around expert periods that GPT SAB analysis missed?

Labeled Data:
  Expert periods: 13,411 segments (5.0%)
  Normal periods: 256,272 segments (95.0%)

1. GPT Baseline Model (5 features: pos_internal, neg_external, pos_external, neg_internal, asymmetry)
   GPT Baseline AUC: 0.720

2. Embedding Model (3072 features)
   Embedding AUC: 0.848

3. Combined Model (GPT + Embedding: 3077 features)
   Combined AUC: 0.861

================================================================================
HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS:
================================================================================

GPT Baseline:           AUC = 0.720
Embedding Only:         AUC = 0.848  (Δ = +0.128)
Combined (GPT + Embed): AUC = 0.861  (Δ = +0.141)

✓ HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED: Embeddings detect linguistic patterns around expert periods
  Even though SAB proportions show no difference, embeddings capture other signals
  (e.g., tone, complexity, semantic coherence, defensiveness)

[2/5] Bias Vector Extraction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Extracting Linguistic Signature Vector
================================================================================
Computing direction in embedding space that captures expert-period patterns

  Expert period samples: 13,411
  Normal period samples: 256,272

✓ Linguistic signature vector extracted
  Separation magnitude: 0.0591
  (Larger = stronger linguistic distinction between expert/normal periods)

  Signature Score Distribution:
    Expert period mean: +0.032 (std: 0.087)
    Normal period mean: -0.027 (std: 0.082)
    Score separation: 0.059
    Cohen's d effect size: 0.700
    → MEDIUM effect

  Usage: signature_score = dot(new_embedding, signature_vector_normalized)
         Positive score → Expert-period linguistic pattern
         Negative score → Normal-period linguistic pattern

[3/5] Bias Period Comparison
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Comparing Expert Period vs Normal Period Embeddings
================================================================================
  Expert period segments: 13,411
  Normal period segments: 256,272

Period Comparison Results:
  Euclidean distance: 0.0591
  Cosine similarity: 0.994
  Expert period variance: 0.0148
  Normal period variance: 0.0148
  ✗ No clear embedding difference between periods
  → Language patterns similar across expert and normal periods

  Variance Explained:
    Top 10 components: 20.1%
    Top 20 components: 29.2%
    All 50 components: 43.4%

  Suggested elbow point: 1 components
    (Captures 4.0% of variance)

  Target vs Peer Separation in PCA Space:
    Separation in full space: 0.0438
    Separation in PCA space: 0.0363
    Retained separation: 83.0%

  Correlating Components with Expert Periods:

    Components Most Correlated with Expert Periods (Top 5):
      PC 8: r=-0.045 ***  (explains 1.3% variance)
      PC 7: r=+0.033 ***  (explains 1.5% variance)
      PC 9: r=+0.031 ***  (explains 1.3% variance)
      PC 6: r=-0.024 ***  (explains 1.6% variance)
      PC 3: r=-0.016 ***  (explains 2.2% variance)

  Usage:
    - Use top 1 components for classification
    - Use PC1 & PC2 for 2D visualization
    - Examine component loadings to understand linguistic dimensions
