# IMPORTANT VERSION NOTES:
# ======================

# Python 3.9 Compatibility:
# These versions are specifically chosen to work with Python 3.9.18
# and are verified to exist in PyPI

# Key Changes from Previous Version:
# - numpy: Changed from >=2.2.0 to >=1.24.0,<2.1.0 (2.2.0 doesn't exist)
# - pandas: Kept >=2.0.0,<2.1.0 (works with Python 3.9)
# - torch: Kept >=2.0.0,<2.1.0 (works with Python 3.9)

# OpenAI v0.28.0 REQUIRED:
# The codebase uses the legacy OpenAI API format (openai.ChatCompletion.create)
# OpenAI v1.x+ has breaking changes and requires code modifications
# DO NOT upgrade to openai>=1.0.0 without updating the API calls

# SpaCy language model needs to be downloaded separately:
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# NLTK data downloads are handled automatically in the code:
# punkt_tab (or punkt for older versions)

# Sentence transformer models download automatically:
# all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dimensional embeddings)
